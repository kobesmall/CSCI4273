Hereditary is a 2018 American supernatural psychological horror film written and directed by Ari Aster in his feature directorial debut. It stars Toni Collette, Alex Wolff, Milly Shapiro and Gabriel Byrne as the members of a family haunted by a mysterious presence after the death of their secretive grandmother.

Aster's short film work attracted the attention of A24, who greenlit Hereditary as his first feature film. Aster conceived it as primarily a family drama and a story consisting of two distinct halves. Filming took place in Utah in 2017, with most indoor scenes filmed on custom built sets on a sound stage to give the film a dollhouse aesthetic.

Hereditary premiered on January 21, 2018, in the Midnight section at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival[4] and was theatrically released in the United States on June 8, 2018.[5] The film received acclaim from critics, with particular praise for Colletteâ€™s performance and Aster's direction. It is considered by many to be one of the greatest horror films of all time.[6][7][8] It made over $80 million on a $10 million budget to become A24's highest-grossing film worldwide at the time.[9][10]
